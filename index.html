       <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Charles Babbage's life</h3>
       <ul>
         <li><strong>26 December 1791</strong> Born in London, England</li>
         <li><strong>12 April 1814</strong> He received an honorary degree, without even being examinated</li>
         <li><strong>14 June 1822</strong> Babbage presented something that he called "difference engine" to the Royal Astronomical Society and in a paper entitled "Note on the application of machinery to the computation of astronomical and mathematical tables."</li>
         <li><strong>21 December 1822</strong> He discussed the main principles of a calculating engine in a letter he wrote to Sir H. Davy.</li>
         <li><strong>6 October 1824</strong> Babbage won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society "for his invention of an engine for calculating mathematical and astronomical tables".</li>
         <li><strong>2 January 1832</strong> Babbage published On the Economy of Machinery and Manufacture.</li>
         <li><strong>14 October 1846</strong> to 2 March 1849 Babbage started designing a second difference engine using knowledge gained from the analytical engine. It used only about 8000 parts, three times fewer than the first. It was a marvel of mechanical engineering.</li>
         <li><strong>18 October 1871</strong> Charles Babbage died</li>
         <li><strong>13 june 1991</strong> A difference engine was completed, starting from Babbage's original plans, and it functioned perfectly.
